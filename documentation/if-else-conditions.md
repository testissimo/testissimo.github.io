# If-Else Conditions

Like in another languages "if - else if - else" sequence is used to go through logical expressions (from top to bottom) and check if passed. If one will pass, the code inside will be executed and then skipped to the "end if". If-Else is a code block, so it always needs to be paired with "end if".

Logical checks are assertions, so all of the assertion actions are available. Use "not" as in assertion to define a negative condition, see the image below.
