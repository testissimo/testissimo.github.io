# Concept Of Writing Tests

## Tests Componsition

In Testissimo, the test is written as simple, readable and parametrised code, composed from:
0. [Variables](#/documentation/documentation/variables) - "variable username: John"
1. [Selectors](#/documentation/documentation/selectors) - "select: div"
2. [User Actions](#/documentation/documentation/actions), [Assertions](#/documentation/documentation/actions) and [Repeaters](#/documentation/documentation/repeaters) - "do click",  "assert elements count is: 1", "repeat for each value in: 1,2,3" 
3. [Components](#/documentation/documentation/components) - "find button", or "enter panel"
4. [Methods](#/components-and-methods) - "call button - click"
5. [Tests](#/tests) - "run login"
