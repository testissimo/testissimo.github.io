# What Is Testissimo

Testissimo is an end-to-end testing tool for web applications. 
Automated test, running test in suites (set of test), built-in VCS, code-completion and much more awaits you in **Testissimo**.


Unlike Selenium or other testing tools, **Testissimo** automates the browser from within - as a part of the tested application. That said, everything you need to start testing is a browser, no installation required. 

## Testissimo's Place In Software Development

### 1. Unit testing
Unit tests are crucial parts of any application. In order to ensure all input states correspond with predefined output states, your tests should test the smallest units of your code, such as functions for example. However, keep in mind that this approach does not guarantee that units will function well together. But then again, that's not what unit testing is about. 

### 2. Integration testing
It's important never to forget or skip integration tests. Otherwise, even in production, you might find your application in an invalid or improperly working state when dealing with joined application modules, application connections to database, client (REST APIs) or to other application, because of versioning, hosting, routing, and many more. 

### 3. e2e (end-to-end) testing or UI testing
Testissimo was built for this type of testing. The main purpose of e2e tests is to click through the web UI and satisfy all crucial usage scenarios. Don't let your customers become UI testers, this will harm your public image and open ways to your competitors.
