# Getting started

See [setup](#/setup) if you haven't setup Testissimo yet.

## Creating a User

Since your repo is empty, there are no components to use in the test. Let's write a test without it. Press Space or Ctrl+Space (windows) or Cmd+Space (OSX) and you will see the list of available prefixes - the building blocks of tests.

## Go Through Documentation First

**We strongly recommend** to go through the documentation. You don't have to read all of it, but it is crucial that you learn about the concept of writing tests in testissimo. This will save you many work hours in future, if you decide to do so.
