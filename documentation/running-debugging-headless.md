# Running, Debugging And Headless

## Run And Stop

To run test or any resource, simply press "play" button at right top on test tab. Near is stop button - it is useful only when test or UI freeze or when error stops run. When showing error, whole testissimo is read only, because you can traverse through source and see current scope variables, selectors and entered components. Just press stop to end this state and make Testissimo editable.

If whole run finished without errors, the "play" button remains green - as indicator that run is done and passed.

## Run Method Definition

Running component definition does not sense, because there is only selector, you can do it, but it maked nothing. But running component method is a must while you developing it. Keep in mind that scope is calculated from component definition and it's default variable values, so when component selector is generic, you should temporarly override default variables or maybe whole selector. Use commenting feature (hash "#" prefix) to do this if you want to keep original variables aside.
