# What Is Testissimo

Testissimo is an end-to-end testing tool for web applications.

Testissimo brings you:
- automated **maintainable** testing, 
- running test in suites (set of tests), 
- built-in **VCS**, 
- code-completion,
- **Visual Editing Mode** for non-IT personnel 
- and much, much more right **out of the box**.

During Testissimo development, **maintainibility** was the most important aspect for our team.
<br>We designed Testissimo in a way so that after a short setup, anyone - even people with little to no coding nor testing experience could compose maintainable tests. 
<br>**Also, feel free to contact our helpdesk for any kind of support. You will be met with fast, friendly and helpful answers.**

## About Testissimo
Unlike Selenium or other testing tools, **Testissimo** automates the browser from within - as a part of the tested application. That said, everything you need to start testing is a browser, no installation required. 

### e2e (end-to-end) testing or UI testing
Testissimo was built for this type of testing. The main purpose of e2e tests is to click through the web UI and satisfy all crucial usage scenarios. Don't let your customers become UI testers, this will harm your public image and open ways to your competitors.

### Unit testing
Unit tests are crucial parts of any application. 
<br>In order to ensure all input states correspond with predefined output states, your tests should test the smallest units of your code, such as functions for example. 
<br>However, keep in mind that this approach does not guarantee that units will function well together. But then again, that's not what unit testing is about. 

**It is crucial to understand, that Testissimo is a e2e testing tool in the first place. Using Testissimo for unit testing is rather a helpful feature for testing and that is exactly why unit testing is a part of Testissimo.**

### Integration testing
Deploying a new feature?
<br>Discover bugs and misbehavior automatically before production deployment.

Set up your CI pipeline in a way so that frontend side failures will be detected automatically. Testissimo will fit right in and help you achieve your goal.
