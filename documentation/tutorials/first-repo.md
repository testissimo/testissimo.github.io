In Testissimo, **Repositories (repos)** are the key asset to writing maintainable tests. Repositories in Testissimo are no different from repositories in any other VCS.
If you never heard of VCS before, make sure to read the VCS section in the How-Tos category.

Check out the next section about writing simple tests!


HINTS:
- In Testissimo, you can created folders for tests. This feature allows you to achieve better maintainibility by organization and categorization.

<!-- In Testissimo, **repositories** are reffered to as **repos**. They follow the logic of git repos, so it shouldn't be hard to grasp their concepts.

## Create your first Repo
Whenever you want to start a new testing, creating a repo is the first step to take. ***It is also a step necessary to take in order to set up a test**. 

When creating a repo, you will first have to go to a **Home** page **[1]**. You will see **Repos** and **Actions, Assertions, and Repeaters** listed here. *Select* **Repos** **[2]**' a list of all existing repos will open as well as some other possible actions. *Click* on the **plus sign** **[3]**.

Now you can add a new repo. Make sure you cick on the **"new repo name"** **[1]** and enter the name of you new repository. Let's name it ***new repo***. A space before "/" on left is where you can put a name of a folder or a project you are working on and is optional. Then click on **Create New Repo** on a right **[2]**:

> If you name your folder or project, make sure to create all the relevant repos (and tests) in the correct folder/project name.

Testissimo will show you newly created repo in a list of all the existing ones. Notice that it is listed in **Remote** Repos list. You will have to **download** **(checkout)** it in order to save it to **Local** Repos list.

> By ***downloading*** and saving the repo in **Local** Repos list you are saving your repo to a Testissimo server. You can then easily access files and change them to **Remote** status whenever you want. In further tutorials we will show you how to manage privacy and management settings.

Your **newly created Repo** will show listed in the **Local** Repos list:

## Set up your first Test

***Once you created a repo, you can set up yur very first test.***

To do that, you will have to go to **Repos** and open **Local** list. Here, *select* your repo. We named a new one ***new repo*** so let's select that one:

![createTest1](https://testissimo.github.io/documentation/images/createTest0.png)

Selected Repo's list of **Tests**, **Components**, and **Test Suites** will open. *Click* on **Tests** and a list of all the Tests created in that Repo (if existing) will appear as well as some other options:

![createTest2](https://testissimo.github.io/documentation/images/createTest2.png)

To create a new test, *click* a **plus sign** **[1]**. You can now add the name of your test in **"test name"** tab **[2]**. Let's name it ***new test***. Then *click* on the **Create Test** **[3]**:

![createTest3](https://testissimo.github.io/documentation/images/createTest3.png)

Your **newly created test** will show in Tests list:

![createTest4](https://testissimo.github.io/documentation/images/createTest4.png)

## Accessing your Repos and Tests

Now that you learned to create Repos and Tests, just to give you a quick note on how to access them later.

You can access them on **Home** page, *selecting* **Repos** **Local** list and then a **Repo** you want to create a new test in, or access already saved one:

**HINTS**:
> Pay attention to how you name your folder/project - make sure that

> ***Download (checkout)*** the **newly created Repo** and that way switch it from **Remote** to **Local** mode. This way you are saving your Repo to Testissimo server

> You can after access repos and change them to **Remote** status whenever you want. In further tutorials there will be more about management settings
