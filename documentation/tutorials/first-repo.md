# First Repo and Test set up

**In this tutorial you will learn to:**
> - Create your first Repo
> - Save your Repos to Testissimo server
> - Set up your first Test

In Testissimo, **Repositories (repos)** are the key asset to writing maintainable tests. Repositories in Testissimo are no different from repositories in any other VCS.
If you never heard of VCS before, make sure to read the Additional Info below.

## Create you first Repo
To create your first Repo complete the steps bellow:
1. Navigate to Home 
2. Select Repos
3. Click the Plus button
4. Name your repository and click Create New Repo

// tu bude gifko s krokmi vyssie

At this point your Repo is remote. In order to follow the VCS standards, you now need to Download (checkout) your newly created Repo.
You can do so by **clicking the Download (Checkout) button** right next to your Repo.

Once you have created your first Repo you can create your first Test.

To create you first Test complete the steps below:
1. Click the **Local** button right next to **Repos**
2. Select your newly created Repo
_a new tab will open - this tab will contain every test (and later also components and test suites)_
3. Select Tests
4. Click the Plus button
5. Name your first test and click Create Test

Congratulations, now you have created your first Repo and your first Test.

##Additional info
###VCS
VCS stands for Version-Control-System. As maintainibility is valued utmost in Testissimo, there is a VCS solution provided out of the box in Testissimo.
Repositories are stored at the Testissimo server. In order to make changes or otherwise edit these repositories, a copy of their current state is needed.
The process of downloading a copy of the current state of a repository is called Checkout. 
Once a selected repository is downloaded (checked out) in Testissimo, this repository can be edited. 
Any changes (i.e. new tests added, new components creations, ...) to any parts of a repository are called Changes. 
The amount of changes to a Repo can be previewed in Repos > Local tab. 
After a set of meaningful changes to a repository, these changes should be uploaded back to the server. This is called Pushing Local Changes. 
The reason for pushing changes to a remote server is simple. 
Once these changes are pushed and applied to the Remote Repo - users with access to this repository are informed about these changes and can apply them simply by Downloading (Pulling) and Merging Remote Changes. 
The process of Pushing and Pulling changes is the integral of any VCS solution.
Merging is the process of choosing the fitting change from two different versions. In Testissimo, merging is implemented in the same way as in other popular Version Control Systems.  

###Public and Private Repo settings
While working with your Repos, you can use the Private/Public Repo settings.
- **Public Repos** - repos visible and accessible to all users.
- **Private Repos** - repos with Private settings are only visible to you as the owner by default. You can still manage access by manually adding users in Access Management settings.


HINTS:
- In Testissimo, you can created folders for tests. This feature allows you to achieve better maintainibility by organization and categorization.

<!-- In Testissimo, **repositories** are reffered to as **repos**. They follow the logic of git repos, so it shouldn't be hard to grasp their concepts.

## Create your first Repo
Whenever you want to start a new testing, creating a repo is the first step to take. ***It is also a step necessary to take in order to set up a test**. 

When creating a repo, you will first have to go to a **Home** page **[1]**. You will see **Repos** and **Actions, Assertions, and Repeaters** listed here. *Select* **Repos** **[2]**' a list of all existing repos will open as well as some other possible actions. *Click* on the **plus sign** **[3]**.

Now you can add a new repo. Make sure you cick on the **"new repo name"** **[1]** and enter the name of you new repository. Let's name it ***new repo***. A space before "/" on left is where you can put a name of a folder or a project you are working on and is optional. Then click on **Create New Repo** on a right **[2]**:

![createRepo2](https://testissimo.github.io/documentation/images/createRepo3.png)

> If you name your folder or project, make sure to create all the relevant repos (and tests) in the correct folder/project name.

Testissimo will show you newly created repo in a list of all the existing ones. Notice that it is listed in **Remote** Repos list. You will have to **download** **(checkout)** it in order to save it to **Local** Repos list.

![createRepo3](https://testissimo.github.io/documentation/images/createRepo4.png)

> By ***downloading*** and saving the repo in **Local** Repos list you are saving your repo to a Testissimo server. You can then easily access files and change them to **Remote** status whenever you want. In further tutorials we will show you how to manage privacy and management settings.

Your **newly created Repo** will show listed in the **Local** Repos list:

## Set up your first Test

***Once you created a repo, you can set up yur very first test.***

To do that, you will have to go to **Repos** and open **Local** list. Here, *select* your repo. We named a new one ***new repo*** so let's select that one:

![createTest1](https://testissimo.github.io/documentation/images/createTest0.png)

Selected Repo's list of **Tests**, **Components**, and **Test Suites** will open. *Click* on **Tests** and a list of all the Tests created in that Repo (if existing) will appear as well as some other options:

![createTest2](https://testissimo.github.io/documentation/images/createTest2.png)

To create a new test, *click* a **plus sign** **[1]**. You can now add the name of your test in **"test name"** tab **[2]**. Let's name it ***new test***. Then *click* on the **Create Test** **[3]**:

![createTest3](https://testissimo.github.io/documentation/images/createTest3.png)

Your **newly created test** will show in Tests list:

![createTest4](https://testissimo.github.io/documentation/images/createTest4.png)

## Accessing your Repos and Tests

Now that you learned to create Repos and Tests, just to give you a quick note on how to access them later.

You can access them on **Home** page, *selecting* **Repos** **Local** list and then a **Repo** you want to create a new test in, or access already saved one:

![createFinal](https://testissimo.github.io/documentation/images/createFinal0.png)

**HINTS**:
> Pay attention to how you name your folder/project - make sure that

> ***Download (checkout)*** the **newly created Repo** and that way switch it from **Remote** to **Local** mode. This way you are saving your Repo to Testissimo server

> You can after access repos and change them to **Remote** status whenever you want. In further tutorials there will be more about management settings
