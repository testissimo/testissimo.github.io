# First Repo and Test set up

**In this tutorial you will learn to:**
> - Create your first Repo
> - Save your Repos to Testissimo server
> - Set up yur first Test
> - Find and access newly created Repos and Tests

Before you start writing tests, make sure you first set up **tests** and **repositories**. That way every new test will be organized and it will be easier for you to navigate through content.

In Testissimo, **repositories** are reffered to as **repos**. They follow the logic of git repos, so it shouldn't be hard to grasp their concepts.

## Create your first Repo
Whenever you want to start a new testing, creating a repo is the first step to take. ***It is also a step necessary to take in order to set up a test**. 

When creating a repo, you will first have to go to a **Home** page **[1]**. You will see **Repos** and **Actions, Assertions, and Repeaters** listed here. *Select* **Repos** **[2]**' a list of all existing repos will open as well as some other possible actions. *Click* on the **plus sign** **[3]**.

Now you can add a new repo. Make sure you cick on the **"new repo name"** **[1]** and enter the name of you new repository. Let's name it ***new repo***. A space before "/" on left is where you can put a name of a folder or a project you are working on and is optional. Then click on **Create New Repo** on a right **[2]**:

(createRepo3)

> If you name your folder or project, make sure to create all the relevant repos (and tests) in the correct folder/project name.

Testissimo will show you newly created repo in a list of all the existing ones. Notice that it is listed in **Remote** Repos list. You will have to **download** **(checkout)** it in order to save it to **Local** Repos list.

(createRepo4)

> By ***downloading*** and saving the repo in **Local** Repos list you are saving your repo to a Testissimo server. You can then easily access files and change them to **Remote** status whenever you want. In further tutorials we will show you how to manage privacy and management settings.

Your **newly created Repo** will show listed in the **Local** Repos list:

(createRepo5)

## Set up your first Test

***Once you created a repo, you can set up yur very first test.***

To do that, you will have to go to **Repos** and open **Local** list. Here, *select* your repo. We named a new one ***new repo*** so let's select that one:

(createTest0)

Selected Repo's list of **Tests**, **Components**, and **Test Suites** will open. *Click* on **Tests** and a list of all the Tests created in that Repo (if existing) will appear as well as some other options:

(createTest2)

To create a new test, *click* a **plus sign** **[1]**. You can now add the name of your test in **"test name"** tab **[2]**. Let's name it ***new test***. Then *click* on the **Create Test** **[3]**:

(creteTest3)

Your **newly created test** will show in Tests list:

(createTest4)

## Accessing your Repos and Tests

Now that you learned to create Repos and Tests, just to give you a quick note on how to access them later.

You can access them on **Home** page, *selecting* **Repos** **Local** list and then a **Repo** you want to create a new test in, or access already saved one:

(createFinal)

**HINTS**:
> Pay attention to how you name your folder/project - make sure that

> ***Download (checkout)*** the **newly created Repo** and that way switch it from **Remote** to **Local** mode. This way you are saving your Repo to Testissimo server

> You can after access repos and change them to **Remote** status whenever you want. In further tutorials there will be more about management settings
