## Repository editing lifecycle
 1. **Checkout (download)** - download remote repository, it makes a local copy which you can modify
 2. **Pull (download changes)** - pull changes made by other users which are not in your local copy
 3. **Modify** - modify whatever you want in your local copy (tests, components, test suites, etc...)
 4. **Push (upload changes)** - save your local changes in remote repository

## Public vs private repositories
 - **Private (default)** - not in public repository listing, only users with read assess can see it
 - **Public** - all users can find and read it, great for open source projects
