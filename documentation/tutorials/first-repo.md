# First Repo and Test set up

**In this tutorial you will learn to:**
- Create your first Repo
- Save your Repos to Testissimo server
- Set up your first Test

In Testissimo, **Repositories (repos)** are the key asset to writing maintainable tests. Repositories in Testissimo are no different from repositories in any other VCS.
If you never heard of VCS before, make sure to read the Additional Info below.

## Create your first Repo
To create your first Repo complete the steps below:
1. Navigate to **Home** 
2. Select **Repos**
3. Click the **plus** button
4. Name your repository and click **Create New Repo**

At this point your Repo is remote. In order to follow the VCS standards, you now need to download (checkout) your newly created Repo.
You can do so by **clicking the Download (Checkout) button** right next to your Repo.

Once you have created your first Repo you can create your first Test.

**To create you first Test complete the steps below:**
1. Click the **Local** button right next to **Repos**
2. Select your newly created Repo
_a new tab will open - this tab will contain every test (and later also components and test suites)_
3. Select **Tests**
4. Click the **plus** button
5. Name your first test and click **Create Test**

Congratulations, now you have created your first Repo and your first Test.

## Additional info
### VCS
* **VCS** - Version-Control-System
* **Repositories** - folders containing tests, components, component methods and test suites (in Testissimo)
  * **Public Repos** - repos visible and accessible to all users.
  * **Private Repos** - repos visible only to you as the owner by default and for other users selected by manually adding users in Access Management settings.
  * **Remote** - repos stored at Testissimo server, downloadable and editable afterwards 
  * **Local** - repos downloaded from Testissimo server, editable and runable
* **Actions** - VCS provides many actions for users to keep their code maintainable and consistent
  * **Pulling** - downloading changes from a remote repository
  * **Pushing** - uploading  changes to a remote repository



<!-- VCS stands for Version-Control-System. 
As maintainibility is valued utmost in Testissimo, there is a VCS solution provided out of the box in Testissimo.
Repositories are stored at the Testissimo server. In order to make changes or otherwise edit these repositories, a copy of their current state is needed.
The process of downloading a copy of the current state of a repository is called Checkout. 
Once a selected repository is downloaded (checked out) in Testissimo, this repository can be edited. 
Any changes (i.e. new tests added, new components creations, ...) to any parts of a repository are called Changes. 
The number of changes to a Repo can be previewed in Repos > Local tab. 
After a set of meaningful changes to a repository, these changes should be uploaded back to the server. This is called Pushing Local Changes. 
The reason for pushing changes to a remote server is simple. 
Once these changes are pushed and applied to the Remote Repo - users with access to this repository are informed about these changes and can apply them simply by Downloading (Pulling) and Merging Remote Changes. 
The process of Pushing and Pulling changes is the integral of any VCS solution.
Merging is the process of choosing the fitting change from two different versions. In Testissimo, merging is implemented in the same way as in other popular Version Control Systems.   -->

<!-- ### Public and Private Repo settings
While working with your Repos, you can use the Private/Public Repo settings.
- **Public Repos** - repos visible and accessible to all users.
- **Private Repos** - repos with Private settings are only visible to you as the owner by default. You can still manage access by manually adding users in Access Management settings. -->
