# SET UP YOUR FIRST TEST

Before you start writing tests, make sure you first set up **tests** and **repositories**. That way every new test will be organized in order to make easier for you to navigate through your content.

In Testissimo, **repositories** are reffered to as **repos**. They follow the logic of git repos, You can find out more about repositories here.

## 1. CREATE NEW REPO
Whenever you want to start a new testing, creating a repo is the first step to take. It is also a step necessary to take in order to set up a test. 





To do that, you have to first click on Repos. Once the drawer opens, you will see the Local repos and Remote repos list, and a + sign next to them on right. Click on a + sign to create a new one.
