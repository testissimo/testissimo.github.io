## Why unique nick ?
In Testissimo, repositories are identified by your nick. Hence, the nick needs to be unique.  
Your email is hidden, so even if you create a public repository only your nick and repository name will be visible.

## Don't forget to confirm your email
After successful sign up, a confirmation email will be sent to you.  
Open it and click the confirmation link to verify yourself.
