# BECOME A USER
Now that you have successfully set up the tool, **Testissimo container** will open on the left side of your screen by default. If you are a new user or a registered user not logged in, a **Login form** will appear in the middle of the Testissimo drawer:

Login/Sign up Form:

1. If you want to create a **new user account**, make sure to *Sign up* first:
    - Enter your email and confirm your input by clicking the *Sign Up* button again
    - Testissimo can generate a unique username (**Unique Nick**) for you as well as a password, which saves you time and enables you to start testing as soon as possible
    
2. You will receive an email to confirm your account:
    - Once you confirm account, you can change both username and password according to personal preferences
    
If you are a **current user**, simply *login* by entering your email and password

It takes only a few steps to become a Testissimo user. Once you are logged in (signed up), you can immediately start using the tool.
