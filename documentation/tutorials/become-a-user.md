# BECOME A USER
Now that you have successfully set up the tool, Testissimo container will open on the left side of your screen by default. If you are a new user or a registered user not logged in, a Login form will appear in the middle of the Testissimo drawer. Login and Sign up buttons are placed in the bottom of the form.

Click Sign up if you want to create a new user account. Simply enter your email and confirm your input by clicking the Sign Up button again. Testissimo can generate a unique username (Unique Nick) for you as well as a password, so that you save time and can start testing as soon as possible. 
After that, Testissimo will send you an email to confirm your account. Once you confirm this mail, you can change both username and password and set them up as you personally wish. Generating your Nick and password automatically is a feature that exists so that you save time while testing and you keep being focused on your current task. 

If you are already a user, click Login and enter your email and password
